# contao-print_backend
This extension adds a nice print layout to the Contao backend - for efficient and paper-friendly printing.

Have you ever tried printing a page in the Contao backend? Wouldn't it be nice to have a quick print-out of the site structure before going to that meeting with that client who prefers to jot down notes and sketch in additions on paper rather than on-screen? Indeed, it would! That is what this extension provides: a print-specific layout for the Contao backend.

Usage is simple: install the extension, print a page, done!
